# Catchphrases!
A web-based game, similar to the well-known electronic game, "Catch Phrase," initially produced by Hasbro.
I am not associated with or endorsed by Hasbro, and my game is an independent product. It's worth noting that 
the design and gameplay experience of my version is inspired by the original "Catch Phrase," while maintaining 
its own unique attributes.

# How to Play
## Preparing the game
Ready for a fun-filled game of Catchphrases? Before you begin, gather a group of players, ideally with an even number for a fair game. Divide the group into two teams, ensuring an equal number of players on each team. You'll also need to play the game on a device that can be passed between players- phones and tablets work great for this. Now, let's delve into the gameplay!

## Gameplay
Each game is composed of multiple rounds. To start a round, select the desired decks and press play. A timer will begin counting down, with each round's duration randomly set between 30 and 90 seconds. Keep an eye on the timer; it's a race against the clock! A word from the chosen category will be displayed on the screen.

Your mission is to cleverly guide your teammates to guess the word without using the word itself. You can make gestures, provide creative clues, and let your imagination soar! However, remember these key rules:
- Avoid rhyming with the word.
- Refrain from giving away the first letter.
- Don't use any part of the word in your clue (e.g., using 'shoe' for 'shoe horn').

If the opposing team catches you violating these rules, the round immediately ends, and they earn a point. When your team successfully guesses the word, pass the game unit to a member of the opposing team. It's their turn to press the next button and guide their teammates to guess their word or phrase. The round continues until the timer runs out and signals the end. But be cautious! If you're holding the game unit when the timer runs out, your team loses the round, and the opposing team scores a point. Stay focused and keep the excitement flowing throughout the game!

## Conclusion
Enjoy playing Catchphrases and let the laughter and camaraderie fill the room as you outwit and entertain each other with your clever clues and teamwork.
